***How to Run in Linux Terminal***

I write this based off of everything being in the Home directory. Use 'cd' appropriately to get to the desired directory.

gfortran -o testquest testquest.f90

From here, the code should compile and be ready to run. To run:

./testquest




***To compile a new module***
Use:

gfortran -c module.f90





***Most code requires the proper_cap module in order to run.***

In this case, to run:

gfortran -o testquest testquest.f90 proper_cap.f90
or
gfortran -o name_select name_select.f90 proper_cap.f90 lower_cap.f90






Enjoy!


Running the current main program:

gfortran -o character_build character_build.f90 gender_select.f90 age_select.f90 race_select.f90 location_select.f90 holy_order_select.f90 career_select.f90 background_select.f90 name_select.f90 proper_cap.f90 lower_cap.f90 cap_functions.f90






-------CURRENT ISSUES---------



-------IN PROGRESS---------
Need to make certain careers gender specific.



Import race from previous function for use in Holy Order selector.
Importing things from previous functions to other functions via modules.


------- TO ADD -----------
Print character stats to a file.
